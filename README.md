Hey there, I'm Jacob Brewer, a passionate self-taught full stack web developer and a freelance software engineer from the UK. My passion for software lies with making things possible which you would never have dreamed of. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I develop. Everything is developed in a professional manor and with the correct version control protocol taken into consideration.
